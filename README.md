# Indian Districts Choropleth Template

This is a template for a choropleth map of Indian Districts, optimized for web viewing.

There are a total of 662 districts on the map based on 2011 census, Telangana state's 31 districts and some updated names as of 2018. The source of these shapes is Datameet and Openstreetmap.

Note that these geometries have been overly simplified for the explicit purpose of optmized web-based consumption. Therefore the boundaries are not at all accurate at high zoom levels. The focus here is only on the visualization and not accuracy.
